# Simple JavaScript Calculator 🧮

A small web-based calculator that supports the four basic arithmetic operations.  
Built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for clean, simple styling.

## Features
- Clickable numeric buttons (0–9)
- Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
- Displays typed expressions in real time
- "=" evaluates the expression using JavaScript
- Clear and clean UI layout

## How It Works
- Every button calls the `number(num)` function which appends the value to the input field.
- The `result()` function evaluates the entire expression using `eval()` and prints the output.
- Bootstrap is used for styling the buttons.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS / Bootstrap
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

## Files
- `calculator.html` — Main UI layout.
- `calculator.js` — Functional logic for displaying numbers and evaluating expressions.
- `calculator.css` (optional) — Additional styling that can be added.
